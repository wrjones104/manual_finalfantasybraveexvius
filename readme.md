# Final Fantasy Brave Exvius - Manual AP

## About
In this manual AP version of FFBE, you'll need to keep your wits about you and practice some patience and restraint as you slowly build your team and your power so that you can either clear Season 1 or defeat Omega Weapon! 

## Rules

* Start from a fresh re-roll each game. There are tons of re-roll guides online.
* You may not use any AP reward in-game until you've received it through AP. As a baseline, here are the things you may do from the start:
  * Any World Map missions on Grandshelt, including explorations
  * Any NPC quests
  * Farplane quests and battles (only the Moogle realm)
  * Coin Exchange Shops
* You may summon using tickets or lapis up to your current **Unit Summon** count
  * If you use a 10+1 ticket or similar, it counts as 11 summons
* You may only use units with rarities up to your current **Progressive Vision Rarity** level
  * The **Progressive Vision Rarity** rewards do not apply to story characters - you may awaken Rain, Lasswell and the rest of the story crew to their max rarities without restriction
* You may only use friend units after having unlocked that feature via the **Companion Unit** reward
  * You may only use friend units up to your current level of **Progressive Vision Rarity** 
  * If you receive the **Companion Rarity +1** reward, you may take a companion whose rarity is 1 higher than your current **Progressive Vision Rarity** level (there are 2 of these in the pool, giving you a chance to have friend units at +2 your current rarity level)
* Most things accessible from the main menu are AP rewards, such as **Quest**, **Bundles**, **Panel Quests**, etc.
* Each esper is **progressive** meaning there are 3 rewards per esper. You may only use the espers (and up to the rarity) that you've received as rewards

## Check Rewards

* Unit Summons
* Progressive Vision Rarities
* Progressive Continents (needed to progress through the story)
